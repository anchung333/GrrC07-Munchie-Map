# Munchie-Map
Multiple late nights pulled during my time at Hack Reactor necessitated the development of this app. My fellow engineers and I, too burnt out to painstakingly pick and choose a restaurant that was open at the hours we decided to call it a night, relied on this app to do the picking and choosing for us by narrowing the selections down to 8 random restaurants that were open late and within walking distance of the building.

## Goals
- Further reinforce confidence given complete autonomy and an extreme time limit, and continue to think about how to manage and implement projects
